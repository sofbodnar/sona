Sona is a  research assistant that integrates into your browser and assists in real-time with content understanding, synthesis, and contextual analysis. 


It pulls together relevant data from your open tabs and research materials to provide real-time explanations of complex concepts, including math formulas.  


When you highlight a phrase or a math formula, a small tab will pop asking “ask sona?” when pressing on that, a short but informative explanation will pop up explaining that difficult concept/word, with useful youtube links to watch. 


Additionally, it manages sessions of research, allowing you to track and build out your ongoing work, and includes the ability to analyze math formulas for mathematical research.
At the end of each research session, you will get the chance to open a one page doc, with things you have learnt while reading, websites you visited with citations, the concepts you asked about.
